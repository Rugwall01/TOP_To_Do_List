set up creation and storage of item objects
set up appention to the screen
styled screen into body with controls and content section


next steps:
    to style the content box to allow overflow,
    to style each content card/line to look good and properly display info,
    to add and style functionality in each card/line to be able to:
            mark important/normal (CHANGE TEXT COLOR OR BACKGROUND AS RESULT)
            mark complete (checkmark or line-through visual)
            delete from the list and re-number all entries

    to add a date and time input in controls that stamps it to the card/line
    to add functionality to create separate projects and have them displayed as switchable tabs
    

    create interface or otherwise to manage data through local storage API.

    make the card/lines expandable so the description shows upon expansion.
